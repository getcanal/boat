### Why?


Stencil is a new approach to a popular idea: building fast and feature-rich apps in the browser. Taking advantage of new capabilities in the browser, such as Custom Elements V1, Stencil enables developers to write faster and lighter components without the weight of frameworks.

The tooling also a solution to teams and library authors building components that support many frameworks. Stencil components work in Angular, React, Ember, and Vue as well as they work with jQuery or with no framework at all, because they're just standards-based components.

Compared to using Custom Elements directly, Stencil provides extra APIs that makes writing fast components simpler. APIs like Virtual DOM, JSX, and async rendering make Stencil Components easy to approach, while maintaining compatibility with Web Components.
