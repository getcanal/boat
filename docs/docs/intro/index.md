# Stencil: A Compiler for Web Components

Stencil is a build tool for generating vanilla Web Components. It combines the best concepts of the most popular frameworks into a straight-forward, compile-time tool.

Stencil takes advantage of

- TypeScript
- JSX
- Async rendering
- V-DOM

With this in place, Stencil generates a Web Component that follows web standards and no particular framework.

Since Stencil generates standards compliant, they can work with many popular frameworks right out of the box, and can even be used without a framework. Stencil also enables a number of key capabilities on top of Web Components, in particular Server Side Rendering (SSR) without the need to run a headless browser, pre-rendering, and objects-as-properties (instead of just strings).
